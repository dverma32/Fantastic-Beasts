          <h3>Newt Scamander</h3>
          <p>
            Newt Scamander is a Magizoologist who has been traveling the world to find and document magical creatures,
            hoping to educate the wizarding world about why they are important and need to be protected. In his travels,
            he has rescued a wide variety of beasts, great and small, which he keeps in a case that magically provides
            more than enough room for the menagerie he cares for and protects. Newt is an outsider, a bit awkward, and
            more comfortable with creatures than his fellow wizards and witches. Hailing from England, he was once a
            student at Hogwarts but was expelled for endangering human life with a beast. Yet there was one professor
            who fought for him, a certain Albus Dumbledore. No one could have imagined then that Newt would someday
            write one of Hogwartsâ€™ most important textbooks: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

          <h3>Porpentina Goldstein</h3>
          <p>
            Tina (short for Porpentina) Goldstein is a smart and determined witch who lives in New York and works for
            MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America). She was once an Auror but was demoted to a menial
            desk job after overstepping her duties when her heart overruled her head and she used unauthorized magic.
            She wants desperately to regain her status as an investigator, which puts her directly in the path of a
            visiting wizard named Newt Scamander. Tina is very close to her younger sister and roommate, Queenie.
